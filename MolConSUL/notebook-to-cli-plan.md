# Notebook to CLI Conversion Plan

This checklist outlines the steps to convert the Jupyter notebook into a command-line interface (CLI) tool.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Understand the Notebook**
  - [ ] Identify the key inputs (e.g., molecule, solvent, calculation parameters).
  - [ ] Map out the major processing steps in the pipeline.
  - [ ] Identify the final outputs (e.g., files, calculated values).

- [ ] **Phase 2: Structure the Python Code**
  - [ ] Create a main Python script file (e.g., `main.py`).
  - [ ] Refactor notebook cells into reusable functions.
  - [ ] Organize functions into logical modules (separate `.py` files) if needed.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Build the CLI**
  - [ ] Learn how to use Python's `argparse` library to handle command-line arguments.
  - [ ] Implement the CLI to accept inputs for the molecule, solvent, etc.
  - [ ] Connect the CLI arguments to the pipeline functions.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Refine and Package**
  - [ ] Add error handling to manage invalid inputs or calculation failures.
  - [ ] Include clear print statements to show progress and results.
  - [ ] (Optional) Structure the project for packaging and distribution.
